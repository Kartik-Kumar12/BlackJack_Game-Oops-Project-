### OBJECT OF THE GAME
* Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21
### Game Play
* Game between a player and a delaer(automated player)

#### Player's Part:-
* The player goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly).
* Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). 
* In the latter case, the player loses and the dealer collects the bet wagered. The dealer then turns to the next player to their left and serves them in the same manner.
#### Dealer' Part
* When the dealer has served every player, the dealers face-down card is turned up. 
* If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card. 
* The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand.
